# AchievementGoals
This repository includes research about parents' income effects on their children's achievement goal structure.
Using Frank (1985), an economic model of social status as a framework, this article explains the effects of parents' rank in income distribution on children's achievement goal orientation. That is, with the concept of positional goods and non-positional goods -- goods where the amount of others' possession matters or not, I used two contrasting achievement goals as a example of positional goods and nonpositional goods, respectively. The main finding of the research is that as parents' rank in income distribution is decreasing, the children's achievement goal is oriented to performance goal which indicates a motivation for a favorable judgement from others or to avoid negative judgement. Also, the performance goal is used as a predictor of challenge-avoidance behavior and learned helplessness (Dweck and Elliot, 1988). The finding is also consistent with proposition in Frank (1985) that the budget share of nonpositional goods is a increasing function of the individual's rank in the income distribution. This research can contribute to internal factors research in economics.
